# The Hat Party
The sickest party.

## Ideas
- Hat summaries
- Transfer button (generate code, funny two word phrase)
- See who wears which hat currently.
- Captains Hat:
    - Ability to send site wide message
- Shared counter at top of site
- Person-to-person interactions:
    - Slap
    - Bow
    - Chug
- No auth, just unique key on name/email
- Potentially
